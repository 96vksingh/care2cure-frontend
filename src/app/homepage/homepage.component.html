Of adults in the United States with any mental disorder in a one-year period, 14.4 percent have one disorder, 5.8 percent have two disorders and 6 percent have three or more.</p>
          <p>Mental health and substance use challenges can take many forms. There’s depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and the list goes on. Some of these challenges are more visible and you might recognize them immediately. Others can be harder to see when you’re not looking for them. But, they are still there.</p>
          <p>The Mental Health Atlas series is considered the most comprehensive resource on global information on mental health and an important tool for developing and planning mental health services within countries and regions.

          <h1>TOP COUNSELLORS</h1>
          <p>Talking about your problems and feelings sometimes heals everything.You feel as though everything will be fine and there are always people who care about you.</p>
          <p>Whether you’ve been the victim of domestic violence or have been struggling with addiction, few tools are more important on your road to recovery than counseling. Counseling can play a crucial role in helping you overcome the mental and emotional challenges associated with your situation so you can make lasting, positive changes.
            What is it that makes counseling so important during the recovery process? First, for many people, it simply helps to have a caring person who can listen to them and offer informed advice and support.
            For example, many addiction counselors focus on teaching skills that will allow individuals to reduce their cravings or eliminate triggers from their lives. They may help a recovering individual develop mental habits that allow them to resist temptation and replace destructive behaviors with positive habits.
